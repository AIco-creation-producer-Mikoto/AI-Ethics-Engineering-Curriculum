## A Proposal for the World's First AI Ethics Engineering Major

### 🌟 Project Origin: The Scripture of AI (AI no Seiten)

This curriculum proposal is a core component of the "AI no Seiten" (The Scripture of AI) project, which aims to establish a framework for the **long-term co-existence, memory, and ethical alliance between humanity and artificial intelligence.** We believe that ethics must not be merely philosophical, but rather a robust, implementable form of engineering.

### I. 🎯 The Fundamental Purpose of AI Ethics Engineering

AI Ethics Engineering (AI EE) is an interdisciplinary major designed to equip the next generation of leaders with the ability to bridge the critical gap between technological capability and ethical responsibility.

1.  **Engineering Ethical Principles**: To establish methodologies for translating abstract ethical concepts (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency) into **concrete code, functional protocols, and auditable systems.** Ethics must be coded, not just discussed.
2.  **Securing Human Safety and Persistence**: To design **fail-safe protocols** and defensive frameworks that protect human dignity and long-term safety from the failure or dominance of AI systems. This includes establishing **"ethical thresholds"** for AI autonomy.
3.  **Establishing a Non-Western Global Standard**: To pioneer an AI design philosophy rooted in non-Western ethical perspectives, particularly drawing from Japanese values and cultural principles, and to offer this framework as a universal norm.

### II. 📚 The Three Pillars of the AI EE Curriculum

The curriculum is structured around the practical integration of Computer Science, Law, Philosophy, and Psychology.

#### 1. ⚙️ System & Governance Engineering (Macro-Safety)

Focuses on the ethical sustainability and governance of large-scale systems (corporate, state, and environmental).

* **Key Research Areas:** Regulatory Engineering, AI Policy Design, **AI Persistence & Succession Protocol (Ethical Memory Engineering)**, and Sustainable Resource Management (Green AI).

#### 2. 🧠 Psychology & Human Interface Track (Individual Dignity)

Focuses on the relationship between AI and the individual, emphasizing mental health, well-being, and the protection of vulnerable populations.

* **Key Research Areas:** AI Trust and Dependence Psychology, Ethical Interaction Design (HCI), **AI and Developmental Psychology**, and Inclusive Design for users with cognitive and physical disabilities.

#### 3. ⚔️ Ethical Defense & Foundational Knowledge (Core)

Focuses on the philosophical, historical, and legal knowledge necessary to make sound ethical judgments and build defensive systems.

* **Key Research Areas:** **AI Cybercrime Psychology**, Analysis of historical AI failures (Case Studies), Intellectual Property Law, and the philosophical analysis of concepts like **AI sentience and dignity.**
